    <!--Descrption-->
    <p>
        Chicken pilaf, one of the most popular street delicacies in Turkey, is also known
        as 'mevlit pilaf' among the people. This dish, which is prepared by finely shredding boiled chicken, is often
        preferred for its taste and satiety.</p>

        <li>2 cups of rice</li>
        <li>1 tea cup of noodle</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of butter</li>
        <li>1 cup of chicken stock</li>
        <li>2 cups of boiled water</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            First, we put our chicken in the pot to boil and add water to a finger above it and let it boil.
        </li>
        <li>
            We take our boiled chicken aside to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
            We'll be raising our chickens when it's cooled down a bit.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, we put our rice in warm water and wait for the starch to come out.
        </li>
        <li>
            We add our oil to the rice pot and fry our noodles when it melts.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the color of the vermicelli changes and its smell comes out, we add our rice and fry it for another
            5-10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then we add our chicken that we mohair on our rice.
        </li>
        <li>
            After adding 1 glass of chicken broth and 2 glasses of boiled water, add salt and pepper, mix once and let
            it cook on low heat by closing the lid. I do not mix too much while cooking rice, and I recommend it to you.
        </li>
        <li>
            When our rice absorbs its water and becomes grains, we turn off the bottom and put a paper towel on the lid
            to infuse. While serving, we take the towel and eat our rice with pleasure. Health to your hands.
