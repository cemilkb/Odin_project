        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                For the meatballs; Let's knead minced meat, eggs, grated onion and garlic, half a tea glass of
                breadcrumbs,
                black pepper, paprika and salt in a deep bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let's form the meatballs into flat and long shapes and place them on the baking tray with baking paper.
                Let's bake them for 10-12 minutes in a heated oven at 185 degrees.
            </li>
            <li>
                After taking our meatballs out of the oven, let's take 1 piece of phyllo on the counter and divide it
                into
                two.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let's spread the melted butter well on the half dough.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let's put our meatballs on the wide side of the dough in a single row and fold the edges of the dough in
                the
                form of a roll. You should not wrap it too loosely at this stage.</li>
            <li>
                After wrapping all the meatballs in the same way, let's slice our rolls in a diagonal shape and arrange
                them
                on a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let's put melted butter on them and put them back in the oven.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let's bake them in the oven heated to 185 degrees until they turn slightly pink.
            </li>
            <li>
                For the sauce; Melt the butter in a small pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let's pour the tomato grater on it and cook for 3-4 minutes. If it is not tomato season, you can add
                tomato
                paste to give color.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, add the spices and salt and mix, then remove from the stove.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let's take our meatballs to the serving plate. Let's put a lot of yogurt in the middle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let's serve it after pouring tomato sauce on it and sprinkling finely chopped parsley.
            </li>
        </ol>
