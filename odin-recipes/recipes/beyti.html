    <ol>
        <li>
            For the meatballs; Let's knead minced meat, eggs, grated onion and garlic, half a tea glass of breadcrumbs,
            black pepper, paprika and salt in a deep bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let's form the meatballs into flat and long shapes and place them on the baking tray with baking paper.
            Let's bake them for 10-12 minutes in a heated oven at 185 degrees.
        </li>
        <li>
            After taking our meatballs out of the oven, let's take 1 piece of phyllo on the counter and divide it into
            two.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let's spread the melted butter well on the half dough.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let's put our meatballs on the wide side of the dough in a single row and fold the edges of the dough in the
            form of a roll. You should not wrap it too loosely at this stage.</li>
        <li>
            After wrapping all the meatballs in the same way, let's slice our rolls in a diagonal shape and arrange them
            on a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let's put melted butter on them and put them back in the oven.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let's bake them in the oven heated to 185 degrees until they turn slightly pink.
        </li>
        <li>
            For the sauce; Melt the butter in a small pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let's pour the tomato grater on it and cook for 3-4 minutes. If it is not tomato season, you can add tomato
            paste to give color.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, add the spices and salt and mix, then remove from the stove.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let's take our meatballs to the serving plate. Let's put a lot of yogurt in the middle.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let's serve it after pouring tomato sauce on it and sprinkling finely chopped parsley.
        </li>
